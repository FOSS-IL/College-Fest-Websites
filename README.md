# College-Fest-Websites
For long there has been a knowledge and communition gap between students and their subsequent seniors. Each year arrangements are made to organize college fest and each year we fail to effectively communicate the changes down to our juniors. More often than naught they have to start their preparations from scratch each year which in turn thwarts the exponential growth our college has the potential to achieve. This repository will help begin the change by making all the three fest websites available online so that the their layouts, backend, and databases can be put to use in subsequent editions of these fests.
